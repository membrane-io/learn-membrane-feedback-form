# `learn-membrane` feedback form

This Membrane program is a complement to the [learn-membrane tutorial](https://membrane.io/share/membrane/learn-membrane).

The program does two things:

1. Serves an HTML form from [its HTTP endpoint](https://spare-346-sector-257-manner-983-bet.hook.membrane.io) to accept product feedback from users
2. Handles form submissions and emails the Membrane team
