# Membrane getting-started tour feedback form

This Membrane program is a complement to the [getting-started tour](https://github.com/pmillspaugh/membrane-getting-started).

The program does two things:

1. Serves an HTML form from [its HTTP endpoint](https://tea-686-match-648-show-976-cut.hook.membrane.io) to accept product feedback from users
2. Handles form submissions and emails the Membrane team
